Focus on what can be done

Now i want to get statistic of a player in seasonYear through calculation as this is the expected response:{
  "scoredGoals": 0,
  "playingTime": {
    "value": 0,
    "durationUnit": "SECOND"
  }
} from this endpoint /players/{id}/statistics/{seasonYear}

SELECT COUNT(*) AS goal_count
        FROM match_scorers ms
        JOIN match m ON ms.match_id = m.id
        WHERE ms.player_id = 'p-st-1'
          AND m.season_year = 2024
